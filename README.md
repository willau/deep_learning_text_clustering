# Unsupervised short text clustering using CNN

Trying CNN architecture for short text unsupervised clustering. 

In the past few years, they have been attemps of using CNN on NLP tasks such
as NER, machine translation or text categorization. Instead of using RNN
model adapted to the sequential nature of sentences, word embeddings are fed to
a CNN in other to perform the task at hand. CNN offers the opportunity of
making training and inference faster than sequential architecture such as RNN.

This work is based on:
- Self-taught Convolutional Neural Networks for Short Text Clustering (2016)
- Natural Language Processing (Almost) from Scratch (2011)
